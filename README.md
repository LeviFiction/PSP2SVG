# PSP2SVG
SVG Exporter for PaintShop Pro

## Requirements
* PaintShop Pro
* OS python library
* XML python library
* Tkinter python library
* tkFileDialog library
* Struct python library
* UUID python library
* Math python library

## Notes:
Not yet in any way shape or form complete.  Attempts to do the basics of exporting path data only.  No colors, gradients, pattern/image data.  This can result in anything that isn't a solid filled in form looking wrong.

## Plans for improvment
* Figure out how to add the allowed style ends as they are specific to PSP
* Pattern Support? (Unknown if this will be reasonably do-able)
* Add support for some basic Layer FX like Drop Shadow or Bevel.
